Learning About Objects: 
      Objects are king in javascript without Objects we can really define java script.

What are Objects: 
      Objects are thing like house,people,animals,etc 

for example:
      A car Object has: 
            properties &
            Methods
      properties of a car: 
            car.name
            car.model
            car.weight
            car.color 
      Methods of a car: 
            car.start()
            car.drive()
            car.brake()
            car.stop()

Objects are variable,but unlike other ones the can contain many values!
Example: lets use "Let" if we want to define the type,model,color of a car using "Let" it would require calling each and using three lets
          like: 
              let model = ,,
        using objects
            const car = {type:"BMW",model:"500",color:"white"}


JavaScript Object Definition:
      using Object literals 
      using new keyword 
      using Object constructor

Object literals:
  Are list of name:value pairs inside curly braces{}
  Also called Onject initializers 
The new keyword:
  const Person = new Object()
  and then add the properties leter
  but object literal is more prefereble 

How to Access those object properties:
    Used keyword: objectName.propertyName
    anotherone is: objectName["propertyname"]

JavaScript Object Methods:
  Methods are action that can be performed on Objects
  methods are funtion definitions stored as property values.

Javascript Objects are Mutable:
  because they are addressed by reference,not by Value..
